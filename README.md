### Hi, I'm Pablo! ðŸ‘‹
I am a web developer from Santa Clara del Mar, Argentina.
When I'm not tending to my family, you'd normally find me dabbling around buttons, responsive layouts and http requests. :computer: :iphone:


#### Right now :fire:
I am working as a freelance dev for a local company, helping maintain a large php-based application. I also collaborate with [Chingu's Facilitators Team](https://chingu.io), helping with code reviews from newcomers to the platform.


#### Find me ðŸ’¬
* I try out most of my ideas over at [Codepen](https://codepen.io/pablowbk). :popcorn:
* Wrote a couple of posts on [Dev.to](https://dev.to/pablowbk)'s platform.
* You can follow me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/wbkpablo).
* [LinkedIn](http://linkedin.com/in/pablowbk) is also up.
